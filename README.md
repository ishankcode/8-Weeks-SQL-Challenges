# 8-Weeks-SQL-Challenges

This repository contains the solution for the 8 case studies from the #8WeekSQLChallenge.
Through this I solved various SQL challenges and I believe this demonstrates my proficiency in SQL query writing and problem-solving skills as some of the problems
were comparitvely very difficult and Unique.

A special thanks to Data with Danny for creating these insightful and engaging SQL case studies!
