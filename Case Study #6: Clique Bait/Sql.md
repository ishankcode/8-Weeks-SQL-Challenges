### Problem Statement
Clique Bait is not like your regular online seafood store - the founder and CEO Danny, was also a part of a digital data analytics team and wanted to expand his knowledge into the seafood industry! In this case study - you are required to support Dannyâ€™s vision and analyse his dataset and come up with creative solutions to calculate funnel fallout rates for the Clique Bait online store.

### Part B - Digital Analysis

**Q1 How many users are there?**
````sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) 
FROM users;
````
OUTPUT: 500

**Q2 How many cookies does each user have on average?**
````sql
WITH CTE AS 
(
SELECT user_id, COUNT(cookie_id) AS cookie_count 
FROM users 
GROUP BY 1
)
SELECT SUM(cookie_count)/COUNT(*) AS avg_cookies
FROM CTE;
````

Output (Avg_Cookies): 3.5640

**Q3 What is the unique number of visits by all users per month?**
````sql
SELECT MONTH(event_time), COUNT(DISTINCT visit_id)
FROM events
GROUP BY 1 ;
````

**Q4 What is the number of events for each event type?**
````sql
SELECT event_type, COUNT(*) 
FROM events 
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 desc;
````

**Q5 What is the percentage of visits which have a purchase event?**
````sql
WITH CTE AS
(
	SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT visit_id) AS pur_visit
	FROM events
    WHERE event_type = 3
)
SELECT ROUND(100*pur_visit/(SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT visit_id) FROM events),2) as PURCHASE_Perc
FROM CTE;
````

OUTPUT(Purchase_Perc): 49.86

**Q6 What is the percentage of visits which view the checkout page but do not have a purchase event?**
````sql
WITH cte_visits_with_checkout_and_purchase_flags AS (
  SELECT
    visit_id,
    -- confirm that the only events that occur on the checkout page are views
    MAX(CASE WHEN event_type = 1 AND page_id = 11 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS checkout_flag,
    MAX(CASE WHEN event_type = 3 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS purchase_flag
  FROM clique_bait.events
  GROUP BY visit_id
)
SELECT
  ROUND(100 * SUM(CASE WHEN purchase_flag = 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)/ COUNT(*), 2) AS checkout_without_purchase_percentage
FROM cte_visits_with_checkout_and_purchase_flags
WHERE checkout_flag = 1;
````

Output(checkout_without_purchase_percentage): 27.55

**Q7 What are the top 3 pages by number of views?**
````sql
SELECT E.page_id, COUNT(DIstinct visit_id)
FROM events E INNER JOIN page_hierarchy P ON E.page_id = P.page_id
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 3;
````

**Q8 What is the number of views and cart adds for each product category?**
````sql
SELECT product_category, 
	SUM(CASE WHEN event_type = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS count_views,
    SUM(CASE WHEN event_type = 2 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS count_addcart

**Q9 What are the top 3 products by purchases?**
````sql
-- Here we dont have records of the product names with the purchase event.
-- instead we need to see if visit_id has associate purchase event or not and check if these items have been added to the cart
-- if so then basically these items have been purchased. (So join 3 tables events, page_hierarchy)
SELECT product_id, page_name AS product_name, COUNT(E.event_type) AS num_purchases
FROM page_hierarchy P JOIN events E ON P.page_id = E.page_id 
WHERE E.event_type = '2' AND visit_id IN (SELECT DISTINCT visit_id FROM events WHERE event_type = 3) AND product_id >0
GROUP BY 1,2
order by 3 DESC
LIMIT 3;

### PRODUCT FUNNEL ANALYSIS 

**Using a single SQL query - create a new output table which has the following details:
    - #1. How many times was each product viewed?
    - #2. How many times was each product added to cart?
    - #3. How many times was each product added to a cart but not purchased (abandoned)?
    - #4. How many times was each product purchased?
    - #5. Additionally, create another table which further aggregates the data for the above points but this time for each product category instead of individual           products.**
````sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS product_info;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS product_catgeory_info;

CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE product_info

### PART D - CAMPAIGN ANALYSIS 

**Generate a table that has 1 single row for every unique visit_id record and has the following columns:
    - 1. user_id
    - 2. visit_id
    - 3. visit_start_time: the earliest event_time for each visit
    - 4. page_views: count of page views for each visit
    - 5. cart_adds: count of product cart add events for each visit
    - 6. purchase: 1/0 flag if a purchase event exists for each visit
    - 7. campaign_name: map the visit to a campaign if the visit_start_time falls between the start_date and end_date
    - 8. impression: count of ad impressions for each visit
    - 9. click: count of ad clicks for each visit
    - 10. Optional column) cart_products: a comma separated text value with products added to the cart sorted by the order they were
          added to the cart (hint: use the sequence_number)**
